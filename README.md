```

![docker-run](/assets/docker_run.jpg)

The app will open at <http://localhost:5000/>.

### Building from image on DockerHub

The build image is located in the [hub](https://hub.docker.com/layers/kamilakhamidullina/devops_lab2/latest/images/sha256-b1c11ecae30354b092134033a3f2bc6fcc51b18997a3f9f4660153441d127572?context=repo).
