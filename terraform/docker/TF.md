After changing the external port number

```bash
docker_image.nginx: Refreshing state... [id=sha256:2d389e545974d4a93ebdef09b650753a55f72d1ab4518d17a30c0e1b3e297444nginx:latest]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
-/+ destroy and then create replacement

Terraform will perform the following actions:
