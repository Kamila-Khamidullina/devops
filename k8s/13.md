## Pods

One of replicas has more log entries than the other because:

- Each replica in has its own volume

- Load Balancer distributes requests not equally between replicas,
so we can have different total numbers of entries in different replicas

## Pods in parallel

In our app replicas are independent from each other, so the ordering doesn't matter.
To start the pods in parrallel we need to add to spec:

```bash
podManagementPolicy: "Parallel" 
```

## Bonus: Update strategies

Update strategies in Stateful set are used to control or disable updates for containers, labels, resource request/limits, and annotations for the Pods.

1. OnDelete - user needs to delete pods to update them

1. RollingUpdate - defaul strategy of automated updates
